# Project Dependencies

This project requires several Python libraries to run successfully. Below is a list of these dependencies along with a brief description of their purpose.

## Dependencies

### Core Libraries
- **pygplates**: A library for working with plate tectonics data and models.
- **pandas**: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library.
- **geopandas**: Extends pandas to allow spatial operations on geometric types.
- **gplately**: A library for plate tectonic reconstruction and visualization.
- **numpy**: A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.

### Visualization
- **matplotlib**: A comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- **seaborn**: A statistical data visualization library based on matplotlib.
- **cartopy**: A library for cartographic projections and geospatial data visualization.

### File and Image Handling
- **glob**: A module to find all the pathnames matching a specified pattern according to the rules used by the Unix shell.
- **os**: A module providing a way of using operating system dependent functionality.


### Geospatial Libraries
- **stripy**: A library for constructing spherical triangular meshes.
- **shapely**: A library for manipulation and analysis of geometric objects.
- **xarray**: A library for working with labeled multi-dimensional arrays.
- **rasterio**: A library for reading and writing geospatial raster data.

### Machine Learning
