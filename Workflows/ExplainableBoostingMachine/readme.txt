Workflow Execution Instructions
===============================

Please run the workflow in the following sequence:

1. Testing Parameters Pool
2. Testing Window Size
3. EBM Analysis

Note: Workflow 3. EBM Analysis can be run independently.  
This is to ensure that while testing window size and parameters in Steps 1 and 2, the data created for the final analysis is **not overwritten**.
